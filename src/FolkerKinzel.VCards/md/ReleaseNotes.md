- Version 8 fixes an issue where in previous versions, UID properties containing types other 
than Guid were not preserved. In order to fix this issue, breaking changes at the public interface 
of the library were required.

It's recommended to start new projects using this version. When updating from version 7.x.x,
meaningful compiler error messages will help you to update existing code from obsolete symbols.
